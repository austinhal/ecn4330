# Problems

## Question 1




### (i)

Find the average monthly housing expenditure.

```
[1] 566
```

### (ii)

Find the median monthly housing expenditure.

```
[1] 505
```

### (iii)

If monthly housing expenditures were measured in hundreds of dollars, rather than in dollars, what would be the average and median expenditures?

```
[1] 5.66
```

```
[1] 5.05
```
The mean would be 5.66

The median would be 5.05

### (iv)

Suppose that family number 8 increases its monthly housing expenditure to $900, but the expenditures of all other families remain the same. Compute the average and median housing expenditures.

```
[1] 576
```

```
[1] 505
```
The mean would be 576.

The median would be 505.

## Question 2

Reconcile the shareholders and CEO's disagreement:

```
[1] 0.2
```


The difference between the two percentages (18% - 15%) is 3%, however the percentage change between 15% and 18% is 20%. They are both correct, but looking at the problem from two different positions.

## Question 3 




### (i)

What is salary when exper = 0? When exper = 5? (Hint: You will need to
exponentiate.)


```
[1] 40134.84
```

```
[1] 45935.8
```
The salary at 0 years would be $40,134.84. 

The salary at 5 years would be $45,935.80.

### (ii)
Use this equation: %∆y ≈ (100 ∗ β1)∆x to approximate the percentage increase in salary when exper increases by five years.

```
[1] 13.5
```


### (iii)

Use the results of part (i) to compute the exact percentage difference in salary when exper = 0 and When exper = 5. Comment on how this compares with the approximation in part (ii).

```
[1] 14.45368
```
The  percent change is 14.5% from the part i. Based on our approximation from part ii, we had that after 5 years experience the percentage increase would be about 13.5%.

## Question 4

Let X be a random variable distributed as X ∼ Norm(5,4). Find the probabilities of the following events. Hint: E(X) = 5 and V ar(X) = 4

### (i)

P(X ≤ 6)


```
[1] 0.691
```

### (ii)

P(X > 4)


```
[1] 0.691
```

### (iii)

P(|X−5|>1)


```
[1] 0.617
```

## Question 5





### (i)

Find the probability that the elderly employment rate is at least 0.6 (i.e. 60%).


```
[1] 0.352
```

## Question 6

### (i)

Find the mean and standard deviation when salary is measured in dollars.


```
[1] 52300
```

```
[1] 14600
```
