## Question 2

### (i) 

The null hypothesis would be $H_0: \beta_3=0$. The alternative hypothesis would be $H_1: \beta_3\neq0$

### (ii)

I would expect $\beta_1$ to have a positive sign, since having a larger population would result in more demand for rental housing.

I would expect $\beta_2$ to also have a positive sign, since higher income would likely mean that the cost of living is high as well, meaning housing prices and rental rates would be higher.

### (iii)

Because this is a log-log model, the interpretation of this model should be, *"A 10% increase in population would result an increase of rent of 0.66%.

### (iv)

With a degree of freedom of 60 (64-4), at the 1% level, we

## Question 4

### (i)

We can apply the property of variance: 
$$Var(\hat{\beta}_1-3\hat{\beta}_2=Var(\hat{\beta}_1)+9Var(\hat{\beta}_2)-6 Cov(\hat{\beta}_1,\hat{\beta}_2)$$

### (ii)

$$t = \frac{(\hat{\beta}_1-3\hat{\beta}_2-1)}{se(\hat{\beta}_1-3\hat{\beta}_2)}$$

We will need to identify the standard error, or $se(\hat{\beta}_1-3\hat{\beta}_2)$

### (iii)

If $\theta_1=\beta_1-3\beta_2$ then $\beta_1=\theta_1+3\beta_2$, therefore we can write our population regression model as:

$$y=\beta_0+(\theta_1+3\beta_2)x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+u$$
$$=\beta_0+\theta_1x_1+\beta_2(3x_1+x_2)+\beta_3x_3+u$$
We would estimate y by regressing y on $x_1, 3x_1+x_2,$ and $x_3$. This will allow us to calculate the stand error and coefficient of $x_1$
