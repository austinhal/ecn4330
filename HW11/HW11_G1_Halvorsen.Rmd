## Question 1

### (i)

4. All of the above are consequences


## Question 2

### (i)

The transformed equation would be found by dividing the original, $beer$, by $inc$, which would give us:

$$\frac{beer}{inc}=\beta_0(\frac{1}{inc})+\beta_1+\beta_2(\frac{price}{inc})+\beta_3(\frac{educ}{inc})+\beta_4(\frac{female}{inc})+(\frac{u}{inc})$$

## Question 3

### (i)

It would be **False** because WLS estimates could have more or less bias based on the degree of correlation between the error term in explanatory variables when an important 

\newpage

## Question 4

### (i)

Since our *df* would be the number that values can vary, we now that in our numerator, the degrees of freedom is K+1. For our denominator, the degrees of freedom is n-k-2.

### (ii)

The $R^2$ will always be at least as large from the BP regression and White test because in the BP test, the added variable is $\hat{y_i}^2$, which will always be no less than the original. For the White test, the fitted values are linear functions of the regressors. So we can conclude that the original $R^2$ value is greater or equal to the White test $R^2$.

### (iii)

If we look at our F-test formula, we can see that as $R^2$ increases, so does our test value. So we can conclude that our test doesn't depend on $R^2$, rather, degrees of freedom is more important. Since all three tests have different *df*, it is hard to say which test gives a smaller p-value.

### (iv)

I think that it would be a bad idea. Since our equation already includes $\hat{y_i}^2$, if we add $\hat{y_i}$, our model would suffer from perfect collinearity.

# Computer Exercises

## Question 5

### (i)

Given that our variance should only rely on gender, our model would then look like: $Var(u|male)=\sigma_0+\sigma_1$ where women are represented by $\sigma_0$ and men by $\sigma_1$

### (ii)

```{r comment=NA}
df4 <- sleep75
wls4 <- lm(sleep~totwrk+educ+age+I(age^2)+yngkid+male, df4)
pander(summary(wls4))
```

```{r comment=NA}
wls4_resid <- resid(wls4)
summary(lm(wls4_resid^2~male, df4))
```

Since the coefficient of male is negative, our variance error term u is higher for females than males.

### (iii)

With a p-value of 0.291, which is larger than our alpha 0.05, it is not statistically significant between male and female.

\newpage

## Question 6

### (i)

```{r comment=NA}
df6 <- hprice1 
wls6a <- lm(price~lotsize+sqrft+bdrms, df6)
wls6b <- lm(price~lotsize+sqrft+bdrms, df6)
pander(summary(wls6a))
coeftest(wls6a, vcov=hccm(wls6a,type="hc0"))
```

Comparing our two tests, our errors only differ slightly with the most significant different between LOTSIZE

| Variable  | OLS Std   | Het-robust std  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Constant  | 29.48     | 36.2843         |
| LOTSIZE   | 0.0006421 | 0.0012227       |
| SQRFT     | 0.01324   | 0.0173178       |
| BDRMS     | 9.01      | 8.2836880       |



### (ii)

```{r comment=NA}
wls6c <- lm(I(log(price))~I(log(lotsize))+I(log(sqrft))+bdrms, df6)
pander(summary(wls6c))
coeftest(wls6c, vcov=hccm(wls6c,type="hc0"))
```

Again, we see that many of our standard errors are close to each other using both the OLS and the heteroskedasticity-robust standard error

| Variable  | OLS Std   | Het-robust std  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Constant  | 0.6513    | 0.763351        |
| LLOTSIZE  | 0.03828   | 0.040520        |
| LSQRFT    | 0.09287   | 0.0173178       |
| BDRMS     | 0.02753   | 0.101442        |

### (iii)

After comparing our standard errors, we can see that using log transformations has helped us drastically reduce heteroskedasticity within our model. However, using the OLS standard error versus the Heteroskedasticity-robust standard error over different coefficients only yields a marginal difference in in value.

\newpage

## Question 7

### (i)

```{r comment=NA}
df7 <- vote1
ols7 <- lm(voteA~prtystrA+democA+lexpendA+lexpendB, df7) 
pander(summary(ols7))
```

```{r comment=NA}
ols7_resid <- resid(ols7)
ols7a <- lm(ols7_resid~prtystrA+democA+lexpendA+lexpendB, df7) 
pander(summary(ols7a))
```

When we regress on the error term, we get an $R^2 = 0$. This is because the dependent variable, *voteA*, gave us the estimated coefficients in a way that the error term was uncorrelated with the independent variables. So we are seeing the errors terms that are uncorrelated with our independent variables.

### (ii)

```{r comment=NA}
bptest(ols7)
summary(lm(ols7_resid^2~prtystrA+democA+lexpendA+lexpendB, df7))
```

Using the F statistic method, we get a p-value of 0.05806

### (iii)

```{r comment=NA}
ols_y <- predict(ols7)
summary(lm(ols7_resid^2~ols_y+I(ols_y^2)))
```

Here, we get an F-statistic of of 0.0645, which is greater than our alpha at 0.05, which is slightly higher than our BP test p-value. This would mean that there is slightly less evidence of heteroskedasticity than our BP test showed.

\newpage

## Question 8

### (i) 
```{r comment=NA}
df8 <- k401ksubs
ols8 <- lm(e401k~inc+incsq+age+agesq+male, df8)
pander(summary(ols8))
coeftest(ols8, vcov=hccm(ols8,type="hc0"))
```

Looking at our standard errors from both, the difference is small and such, the difference is not statistically important.

### (ii)

Our fitted values are all between 0 and 1.
